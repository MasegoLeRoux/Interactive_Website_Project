## Project Overview
The Countdown Timer project provides a user-friendly interface for setting a specific date and time. The timer will then count down to that date, providing a visual representation of the time remaining.

## Features
- Set a target date and time for the countdown.
- Real-time updating of the countdown display.
- Clear and intuitive interface for easy use.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structuring the timer interface.
- CSS3 for styling the timer components and layout.
- JavaScript for countdown logic and updating the display.

## How to Use
1. [Clone or download](#installation) the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter the target date and time for your countdown event in the input fields provided.
4. Click the "Start Countdown" button to begin the countdown.
5. The timer will display the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
6. Enjoy tracking your event as the countdown updates in real time.

## Countdown Logic and Display Update
The JavaScript code responsible for the countdown logic and updating the display is located in the `script.js` file. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

1. When the "Start Countdown" button is clicked, the JavaScript code calculates the time difference between the current date and time and the target date and time provided by the user.
2. The time difference is converted into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
3. A function is called at regular intervals (e.g., every second) using the `setInterval()` function. This function updates the countdown display on the web page.
4. Inside the update function, the remaining time values (days, hours, minutes, and seconds) are dynamically inserted into the HTML elements that represent the countdown display.
5. If the countdown reaches zero (the target date and time is reached), the update function can stop the interval and display a message indicating that the event has arrived.

Here's a simplified example of the JavaScript code responsible for the countdown logic:

```javascript
// Get user-provided target date and time
const targetDate = new Date("2023-12-31T23:59:59").getTime();

// Update the countdown display every second
const countdownInterval = setInterval(updateCountdown, 1000);

function updateCountdown() {
  const currentDate = new Date().getTime();
  const timeDifference = targetDate - currentDate;

  const days = Math.floor(timeDifference / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  const hours = Math.floor((timeDifference % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
  const minutes = Math.floor((timeDifference % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
  const seconds = Math.floor((timeDifference % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

  // Update the countdown display elements with the calculated values
  // Display "Event has arrived!" message if countdown reaches zero

  if (timeDifference <= 0) {
    clearInterval(countdownInterval);
    // Display event has arrived message
  }
}
